PROBLEM DEFINITION It is difficult to find a tutor cheaply and quickly. There was a time when finding a tutor relied upon recommendations from friends or looking through newspaper adverts. Often you have to sign up through an agency and tutors can be expensive and slow to find. I decided on a tutoring app whilst trying to find a piano teacher for my son. It was impossible to find a tutor to meet on my time and schedule. Students need to find a tutor in real time and cheaply.

SOLUTION With the immense growth and popularity of on-demand services in other major industries, it makes sense that tutoring will follow. A tutoring app solves a real problem for students of all ages and parents â€” to find an affordable and knowledgeable tutor on-demand.

The design is based on a two sided marketplace whereby tutors can advertise their skills and students can search for tutors based on their skills and locations. Tutors are offered and reviewed online. The app allows you to seamlessly contact tutors nearby and schedule a session at a fraction of the cost of traditional services.
